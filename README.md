Assembly Programming Exercises
==============================

This repository contains solutions to some the exercises for the Assembly Programming course at http://www.xorpd.net.
This is not the official solution, but rather my version of the solution for the exercises. 

To compile the files, you need the "training.inc" file (included in the exercises repository, see below) in your "include"-folder for fasm.
